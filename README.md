## Project Description: 
* MYSQL backend for an e-commerce website.

## Installation 
* Clone the repository to your computer. Open your command prompt or a terminal of your choice and run "npm init -y" to initialize the node package manager. Next you need to install the required node modules by running the command "npm install" in your terminal. Once those commands have been ran you need to log into your MYSQL account by using the command "mysql -u root -p". Once in the MYSQL interface you will run the command "source db/schema.sql". This establish your new database as long as you have not moved your files around since the cloning of the repository. After establishing the source, quit out of MYSQL by typing "quit", and run "npm run seed". This will seed your database with filler data. Your final command is to run "npm start" This will establish your local server. You may now CRUD commands through Insomnia or browse the filler-data in a browser of your choice.

Please watch my YouTube Video for further explanation on the program.
